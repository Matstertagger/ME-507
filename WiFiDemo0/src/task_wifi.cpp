/** @file task_wifi.cpp
 *    This file contains a task which runs a simple WiFi server on an ESP32.
 *    There are many examples out there on the Web, most of which use the
 *    regular Arduino environment with @c setup() and @c loop() functions that
 *    control operation. This file creates a FreeRTOS task instead, using a
 *    technique which should much better for mechatronic programs which have
 *    stringent timing requirements. 
 * 
 *    Inspiration and starting code for this program was found at
 *    @c https://lastminuteengineers.com/esp32-dht11-dht22-web-server-tutorial/

/** @brief   Read a character array from a serial device, echoing input.
 *  @details This function reads characters which are typed by a user into a
 *           serial device. It uses the Arduino function @c readBytes(), which
 *           blocks the task which calls this function until a character is
 *           read. When any character is received, it is echoed through the
 *           serial port so the user can see what was typed. 
 * 
 *           @b NOTE: When run on an ESP32 using FreeRTOS, this function must
 *           allow other tasks to run, so that the watchdog timer is reset.
 *           Otherwise the CPU will be reset.  The @c vTaskDelay() call does
 *           this. 
 *  @param   stream The serial device such as @c Serial used to communicate
 *  @param   buffer A character buffer in which to store the string; this
 *           buffer had better be at least @c size characters in length
 *  @param   size At most (this many - 1) characters will be read and stored
